Project Details:
In this project, we will leverage the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to develop a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of passengers' survival aboard the ill-fated Titanic. We will follow these key steps:

Data Loading: We will start by loading and inspecting the Titanic dataset to understand its structure and variables.

Data Exploration: Next, we will explore the dataset to gain insights into the passengers' demographics, ticket information, and survival outcomes.

Data Categorization: We will categorize and preprocess the data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables to make it suitable for machine learning.

Feature Engineering: We'll create relevant feature columns that capture important information about passengers, such as age, class, gender, and ticket fare.

Linear Regression Model: Utilizing a linear estimator and the linear regression algorithm, we will build a predictive model that can estimate survival probabilities based on the selected features.

Prediction: Finally, we will apply our trained model to predict survival probabilities for every passenger in the evaluation dataset, offering valuable insights into the factors that influenced their chances of surviving the Titanic disaster.

This project combines data exploration, feature engineering, and predictive modeling, making it an engaging and informative exercise in data science and machine learning.
